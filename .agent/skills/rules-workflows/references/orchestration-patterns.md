# Skill Orchestration Patterns

These patterns guide how to combine multiple specialized skills to solve complex problems.

## 1. The "Spec-First" Pattern

**Best for**: New features, major refactors.
**Sequence**: `product-manager` -> `lead-architect` -> `backend-developer`/`frontend-developer`.

1.  **PM**: Defines _what_ and _why_.
2.  **Architect**: Defines _how_ (structure, data flow).
3.  **Dev**: Implements the _code_.

**Rule**: Developers should never start coding without an approved plan/spec from the Architect.

## 2. The "TDD" Pattern

**Best for**: Bug fixes, complex logic with clear inputs/outputs.
**Sequence**: `qa-tester` -> `backend-developer`.

1.  **QA**: Writes a failing test case that reproduces the bug or defines the feature.
2.  **Dev**: Writes code to make the test pass.
3.  **QA**: Verifies and adds regression tests.

## 3. The "Design-Driven" Pattern

**Best for**: UI/UX work.
**Sequence**: `designer` -> `frontend-developer`.

1.  **Designer**: creating the look & feel, animations, and component structure.
2.  **Dev**: Translates the design into React/CSS code.

## 4. The "Delegation" Pattern (Process vs Knowledge)

**Best for**: Enforcing standards within workflows.
**Sequence**: `Workflow` (Process) -> `Skill` (Knowledge).

**Rule**: Workflows define _when_ to do something. Skills define _how_ to do it.

- ❌ **Bad Workflow**: "Step 4: Check that contrast is 4.5:1." (Hardcoded)
- ✅ **Good Workflow**: "Step 4: Verify accessibility using [designer] skill." (Delegated)

## 5. The "Reasoning" Bridge

**Best for**: Ambiguity, complex debugging.
**Approach**: Break down the problem step-by-step before switching skills.

Use step-by-step reasoning as a bridge whenever you get stuck or need to plan the next move.

- "I have the error log, but don't know the cause." -> **Think** -> "Hypothesis: DB connection timeout."
- "I have the requirements, but don't know which library to use." -> **Think** -> "Evaluate options A, B, C."
