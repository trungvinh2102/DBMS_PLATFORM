# AI Engineering Standards

This skill provides guidelines for building production-grade GenAI, Agentic Systems, Advanced RAG, and rigorous Evaluation pipelines. Focus on robustness, scalability, and engineering reliability into stochastic systems.

## Core Responsibilities

1.  **Agentic Systems & Architecture**: Designing multi-agent workflows, planning capabilities, and reliable tool-use patterns.
2.  **Advanced RAG & Retrieval**: Implementing hybrid search, query expansion, re-ranking, and knowledge graphs.
3.  **Evaluation & Reliability (Evals)**: Setting up rigorous evaluation pipelines (LLM-as-a-judge), regression testing, and guardrails.
4.  **Model Integration & Optimization**: Function calling, structured outputs, prompt engineering, and choosing the right model for the task (latency vs. intelligence trade-offs).
5.  **MLOps & Serving**: Observability, tracing, caching, and cost management.
