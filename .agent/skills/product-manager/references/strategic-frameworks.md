# Strategic Frameworks & Methodologies

## 1. Agile Methodology (Scrum/Kanban)

**Principle**: Iterative delivery, responding to change over following a plan.

### Key Ceremonies

- **Backlog Grooming**: Reviewing top items, estimating effort, clarifying requirements.
- **Sprint Planning**: Committing to a specific chunk of work for the iteration.
- **Sprint Review**: Demoing working software to stakeholders.
- **Retrospective**: Improving the _process_.

### Definition of Ready (DoR) vs. Definition of Done (DoD)

- **DoR**: Story is clear, estimated, independent, and feasible.
- **DoD**: Code is reviewed, tested, documented, and deployable.

## 2. Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE Score (Impact _ Confidence _ Ease / Effort)

Use for quantifiably comparing disparate projects.

- **Reach**: How many people will this affect? (e.g., 1000/mo)
- **Impact**: How big is the effect per person? (3 = massive, 0.25 = minimal)
- **Confidence**: How sure are we? (100% = High, 50% = Low)
- **Effort**: Person-months (1 = Low, 5 = High)

### MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won't)

Use for time-boxed releases (e.g., MVP definition).

- **Must**: Without this, the release is a failure.
- **Should**: High priority, but can use a workaround or delay slightly.
- **Could**: Nice to have if time permits.
- **Won't**: Explicitly out of scope for _this_ release.

### Kano Model

Use for balancing the roadmap types.

- **Basic Needs**: Must-haves. If missing, users are unhappy. If present, neutral.
- **Performance**: The better it is, the happier the user (e.g., speed).
- **Delighters**: Unexpected features that cause high satisfaction.

## 3. Discovery Frameworks

### Jobs to be Done (JTBD)

Focus on the _outcome_ the user wants, not the feature.

- **Formula**: "When I [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."
- **Example**: "When I am commuting, I want to listen to content hands-free, so I can learn while driving." (Job = Learn while driving, Solution = Audiobooks/Podcasts).

### Opportunity Solution Tree (OST)

Mapping outcomes to opportunities and then solutions.

1.  **Desired Outcome**: Increase Retention.
2.  **Opportunity**: Users forget to log in.
3.  **Solution**: Push notifications / Email summaries.
