# Branding & Identity Development

Expert guidelines for creating distinctive, memorable brand identities.

## Brand Discovery Process

### 1. Brand Essence Questions

Before any visual work, answer:

- **Purpose**: Why does this brand exist? What problem does it solve?
- **Personality**: If this brand were a person, how would they speak/act?
- **Positioning**: What makes this brand different from competitors?
- **Promise**: What can users always expect from this brand?

### 2. Target Audience Mapping

| Dimension      | Primary | Secondary |
| -------------- | ------- | --------- |
| Demographics   |         |           |
| Psychographics |         |           |
| Pain points    |         |           |
| Aspirations    |         |           |

## Visual Identity System

### Logo Design Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Must work at 16px favicon and billboard sizes
2. **Memorability**: One unique element that sticks
3. **Timelessness**: Avoid trendy elements that date quickly

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice Attributes Matrix
