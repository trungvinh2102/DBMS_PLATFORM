# Bento Grids

**Concept**: Inspired by Japanese lunch boxes (Bento). Content is organized into rigid, yet varied rectangular distinct cells.

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Layout**: CSS Grid based.
- **Content**: Each cell is self-contained (image, text, control).
- **Spacing**: Consistent, typically large gaps.
- **Curvature**: Uniform border-radius on all cells (`24px+`).

**Usage**:

- Product showcases, feature lists, shiny marketing sections.
