# Internal Tools & Platforms Domain

## Overview

Internal tools are software built for internal stakeholders (employees, operations teams). Focus is on workflow efficiency and integration with existing systems.

## Key Entities

- **Employee/User**: With department, role, permissions
- **Workflow**: Process steps, Approvals, Escalations
- **Case/Ticket**: Support cases, operational tasks
- **Report**: Analytics, exports, dashboards

## Common Use Cases

1. **Task Management**: Create, assign, track, close tasks
2. **Approval Workflows**: Request → Review → Approve/Reject
3. **Data Entry/Validation**: Forms with business rule validation
4. **Reporting**: Generate reports, schedule exports
5. **Integration Hub**: Sync data between systems

## Key Metrics to Document

- **Time to Resolve (TTR)**: How long to complete a task
- **Task Completion Rate**: Success vs abandonment
- **Error Rate**: Mistakes requiring rework
- **Adoption Rate**: % of employees using the tool
- **Time Saved**: Efficiency gains vs manual process

## BA Considerations

- **Existing Process Mapping**: Document current state before designing
- **User Shadowing**: Observe real users in their environment
- **Edge Cases**: What happens when things go wrong
- **Offline Capability**: Some environments lack reliable internet
- **Permission Complexity**: Often complex role hierarchies
- **Legacy Integration**: APIs, file exports, database syncs
- **Training Needs**: Users may resist change
