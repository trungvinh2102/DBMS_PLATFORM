# Marketplace / Platform Domain

## Overview

Marketplace platforms connect buyers and sellers (or service providers and consumers). BA focus is on balancing needs of multiple user types and trust mechanisms.

## Key Entities

- **Buyer**: Consumer, Shopper, Renter
- **Seller**: Merchant, Service Provider, Host
- **Listing**: Product, Service, Property
- **Transaction**: Order, Booking, Rental
- **Review**: Ratings, Feedback, Disputes

## Common Use Cases

### Seller Side

1. **Onboarding**: Register → Verify identity → Create first listing
2. **Listing Management**: Create, edit, deactivate listings
3. **Order Fulfillment**: Accept order, Ship/Deliver, Confirm completion
4. **Payout Management**: View earnings, Request payout, Tax documents

### Buyer Side

1. **Discovery**: Search, Filter, Compare listings
2. **Purchase Flow**: Add to cart → Checkout → Payment
3. **Communication**: Message seller, Inquire about product
4. **Post-Purchase**: Track order, Request refund, Leave review

### Platform Side

1. **Dispute Resolution**: Buyer vs Seller conflict handling
2. **Fraud Prevention**: Suspicious activity detection
3. **Commission/Fees**: Take rate calculation, Payment splitting

## Key Metrics to Document

- **GMV**: Gross Merchandise Value
- **Take Rate**: Platform commission percentage
- **Buyer/Seller Ratio**: Market liquidity

## BA Considerations

- **Chicken-and-Egg**: Can't have buyers without sellers (and vice versa)
- **Trust Mechanisms**: Reviews, Verification badges, Escrow
- **Payment Splitting**: Platform fee, Seller payout, Tax handling
- **Dispute Flow**: Who wins when buyer says "not delivered"?
- **Fraud Patterns**: Fake reviews, Shill bidding, Payment fraud
- **Category-Specific Rules**: Different flows for goods vs services
